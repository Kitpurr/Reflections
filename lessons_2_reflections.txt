How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area allows you to only commit what could reasonably be thought of as one change.
It allows you to control what is added to a commit.

A working directory shows you what is in your repository as well as what is in the staging area and will therefore be submitted on the next comit.

The repository is your collection of commits.
